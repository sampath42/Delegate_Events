Develop a shopping cart for an online shopping, should apply the following things
1. Implement seasonal based Discount for particular category of products (free to choose any category)
	eg: On Diwali season few categories like cloths and electronics are eligible for discounts, for Ramzan and Dushera dresings and footwear are eligible for discounts.
	Note: Dont hardcode the seasons and categories, Seasons and Categories are inputs to the application.
Make use of the delegate methods for loosly coupled implementation, so that system should work with any kind of inputs
2. Send a notification when any product is added to cart, any discount is applied to certain product 
3. On completion of purchase, send a notification and also display the status on the screen

Note: Don`t try to implement a core logic, just write Console.WriteLine
